# capi-gce-demo-argocd

This repository handles the CD pipeline of ArgoCD for the GCE demo cluster.

> Note: due to a [certain issue](https://helioag.slack.com/archives/C021K9EM5G9/p1653056083959779) the 
> repository is currently in my own private Gitlab profile (I just added this one as another remote in the meantime)
